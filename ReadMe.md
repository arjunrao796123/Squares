# Description

The dataset contains 3 types of squares, which are visually varying in intensity.
The objective of the problem is to classify the 3 types of squares using any method.

The data is not being provided but the code can be used as opensource.


## Code

The code contains:
 - Histogram plot of images per channel
 - CNN to classify
 - Quantitative analysis of the dataset
 - Feature extraction and PCA using pretrained models(VGG19,VGG16,Resnet)
 - Error analysis to find patterns in the misclassified data

Part 1 contains all expereiments which can be run with the dataset
